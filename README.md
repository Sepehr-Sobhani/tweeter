# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

## When the app is started you can:

- Browse existing tweets listed with the most recent at the top.
- If you would like to tweet, press the "Write a tweet" icon in the navigation menu.
- The yellow button at the lower right hand corner of the screen will scroll to the top of the existing tweets list allowing you to enter a new tweet.
