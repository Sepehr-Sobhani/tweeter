# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a SPA inspired by Twitter. This app is a full stack web application using:

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX
- Server: Node, Express

This app is a project assignment from Lighthouse Labs for The Web Developer Bootcamp. Only the server code and database "dummy" data were given as this was a project for client-side development. All CSS, JS, jQuery, and AJAX coding was performed by the developer.

## App Highlights

- Users can view and create content.
- Users can view the app on various devices as the app has a responsive design.
- The app has various components to add to the user experience from sliding sections to bouncing animations.
- The app notifies the user of their content length and warns the user if it is too long.
